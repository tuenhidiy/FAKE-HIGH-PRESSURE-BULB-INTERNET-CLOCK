Turn a broken high-pressure metal-halide/ sodium bulbs into to home decoration lamp in industrial looking style. It is controlled by NodeMCU ESP8266.
This high pressure lamp can be used as a binary internet clock mode: Time can be read from the NTP server and updated over WIFI by ESP8266 NODEMCU. We need 4 LEDs equivalent to a 4-bit binary number to show each digit and we can identify each digit by specific color.
